Now I am taking my B.E. as a sophomore learning in IIIS. I am keen on computer graphics, especially physically-based and real-time rendering. Some topics in computer system e.g. distributed system and cloud computing also interests me. Feel free to contact me through email if you are looking for collaborators for projects concerning fields above.
